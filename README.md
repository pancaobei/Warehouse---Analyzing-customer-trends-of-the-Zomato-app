# Zomato Data Warehouse Project

## 1. Introduction

In the digital age, data plays a crucial role in shaping business strategies and making accurate decisions. The Zomato application, a renowned platform in the food service and restaurant review industry, collects vast amounts of data from users and restaurants worldwide. Building a data warehouse from Zomato's dataset can provide deep insights into culinary trends, user behavior, and the business performance of restaurants.

### 1.1. Solution

- **Data Integration and Organization**: Collect, clean, and reorganize data from Zomato to create a consistent and easily retrievable data warehouse.
  
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Utilize analytical and visualization tools to explore significant data patterns and trends.
  
- **Decision Support**: Provide valuable insights to stakeholders such as restaurants, users, and Zomato managers to enhance services and customer experiences.

To derive useful information, we will address the following questions:

- What are the top 10 most profitable restaurants?
- What are the top 10 restaurants operating at a loss?
- Which restaurants have the highest number of reviews and ratings?

### 1.2. Objectives and Significance of the Project

The project aims to create an integrated and consistent data warehouse while providing analytical and visualization tools. This will yield valuable insights that support businesses in making informed decisions regarding future directions, while ensuring data safety and security.
